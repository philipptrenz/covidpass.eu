  md: Hi, we are Donatus and Philipp. Two developer and designer with a 💙 for innovative
    solutions and intuitive user experience to overcome social challenges and (re)enable
    participation. COVID has been a major constraint on all of our lives over the
    past few months. Gradually, some normality is now returning. With this tool, we
    want to make a small contribution to making everyday life and travel a little
    easier. Thanks to Ann-Kathrin, who contributed the logo. We created COVID Pass
    for iOS within our spare time and pay the server costs out of our own pocket.
    If you find this project useful, please feel free to support us.

    Second, the following steps happen on our server:

    * Receiving and checking the hashes which were generated locally

    * Signing the file containing the hashes

    * Sending the signature back


    Finally, the following steps happen locally in your browser:

    * Assembling the signed pass file out of the incomplete file generated locally
